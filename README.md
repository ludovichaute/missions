## About the Project

This project will helps us to learn how to realise a project in real situations. It is just an exercise from [BeCode](https://github.com/becodeorg/)
For this, we have to make a mobile application with a personal account where:
- You can enter the skills you want to share and personal details (country, region, age) 
	ex: Silvia Steisel, based Brussels, skills: communication, HR, French, Dutch, English
- A list of projects with missions that need skills you have 
	ex: Becode needs HR trainers
- Apply to a project that sends an automated email to the project + foundation with his profile details
- An inbox or alert system that tells you if you have the mission
- A dashboard to manage your mission: puts the date in your outlook agenda, an automated counter tells you how much time you have spend
- You can rate the project.
